Exercises for the course Introductory Digital Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology. 

These exercises were given to students on year 2009. The solutions to the exercises are also included 
in this repository. Such solutions were publicly available on the course web-page and that is why 
I don't see any problem in making them even more widely available. As far as I know I am the sole 
author of all the materials in this repository so I am the only responsible for any typos or mistakes. 
If you find any, please let [me](mailto:g@germangh.com) know!
