\textbf{PROBLEM 1:} Determine the DTFT of each of the following sequences:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $x_a[n] = \mu[n]-\mu[n-5]$
\item[(b)] $x_b[n] = \alpha^n\left(\mu[n]-\mu[n-8]\right) \qquad |\alpha|< 1$
\item[(c)] $x_c[n] = (n+1)\alpha^n\mu[n] \qquad |\alpha|<1$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PROBLEM 2: (problem 3.41 from the book)} Let $G_1(e^{j\omega})$ denote the discrete-time Fourier transform of the sequence $g_1[n]$ shown in the figure below. Express the DTFTs of $g_2[n]$, $g_3[n]$ and $g_4[n]$ in terms of $G_1(e^{j\omega})$. Do not evaluate $G_1(e^{j\omega})$.

\[
\begin{array}{lll}
h_1[n] &=& \frac{\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}n)}{\pi n}\\
h_2[n] &=&(0.3)^{n}\mu[n]\\

\textbf{PROBLEM 7 (problem 3.59 from the book):} An LTI IIR discrete-time system is described by the difference equation
\[
y[n] + a_1y[n-1] = b_0x[n]+b_1x[n-1]
\]
where the input is $x[n]$, the output is $y[n]$, and the constants $a_1$, $b_0$ and $b_1$ are real. Determine the expression for its frequency response. For what values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ will the magnitude response be a constant for all values of $\omega$?.

\textbf{PROBLEM 8:} Consider the system defined by the difference equation 

\[
y[n] = ay[n-1]+bx[n]+x[n-1]
\]

where $a$ and $b$ are real, and $|a|<1$. Find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ that must exist if the frequency response is to have a constant magnitude for all $\omega$, that is $|H(e^{j\omega})|=1$.
